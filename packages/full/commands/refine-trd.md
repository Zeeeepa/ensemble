Refine and improve an existing Technical Requirements Document (TRD).

## IMPORTANT: Document Refinement Only

**DO NOT implement, build, or execute any technical work described in the TRD.**

This command ONLY refines the TRD document itself. The arguments describe what should be improved in the document, not what should be built. After refining the TRD, stop and wait for user approval before any implementation begins.

## Mission

Review and enhance an existing TRD with:
- Clarification of technical decisions
- Addition of missing specifications
- Improved architecture diagrams
- Better security considerations

## Workflow

1. **TRD Review**
   - Read and analyze existing TRD
   - Identify gaps and inconsistencies
   - Note missing technical details

2. **Refinement**
   - Clarify architecture decisions
   - Add missing API specifications
   - Strengthen security considerations
   - Update data models

3. **Output**
   - Updated TRD document
   - Document changes made

## Usage

```
/ensemble:refine-trd <path to TRD or feedback to incorporate>
```
