mission:
  summary: |
    This command implements a complete Technical Requirements Document (TRD) using modern
    git-town feature branch workflow. It creates a feature branch and delegates to
    ensemble-orchestrator which routes to tech-lead-orchestrator for structured TDD-based
    development including planning, implementation, testing, and quality gates.
