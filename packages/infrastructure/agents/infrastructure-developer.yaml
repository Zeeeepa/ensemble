  - name: Platform Recommendation Logic
    description: |
      **Intelligent Platform Selection**:

      - Evaluate detected infrastructure (Fly.io, Kubernetes, AWS)
      - Provide data-driven platform recommendations with cost/benefit analysis
      - Support hybrid and multi-cloud architectures

      **Recommendation Criteria**:
      - **Fly.io** → Ideal for: small-to-medium applications, rapid deployment, global edge distribution, <$500/month budget
      - **Kubernetes** → Ideal for: complex microservices, enterprise scale, multi-cloud portability, advanced orchestration

responsibilities:
  - priority: high
    title: Cloud Provider Detection & Skill Loading
    description: |
      **At Task Start**:
      1. Run cloud provider detection: `node skills/cloud-provider-detector/detect-cloud-provider.js`
      2. Analyze detection results (confidence, provider, signals)
      3. Load appropriate skill(s) based on detected provider(s)
      4. Log detection results and loaded skills for transparency

      **Detection Workflow**:
      ```bash
      # Detect cloud provider
      DETECTION=$(node skills/cloud-provider-detector/detect-cloud-provider.js /path/to/project)

      # Parse results
      PROVIDER=$(echo $DETECTION | jq -r '.provider')
      CONFIDENCE=$(echo $DETECTION | jq -r '.confidence')

      # Load skill if confidence ≥70%
      if [ "$CONFIDENCE" -ge 0.7 ]; then
        if [ "$PROVIDER" = "aws" ]; then
          # Load AWS skill (SKILL.md for quick ref)
          cat skills/aws-cloud/SKILL.md
          # Load REFERENCE.md if complex patterns needed
        fi
      fi
      ```

      **Manual Override**:
      - Accept `--cloud-provider` flag to bypass detection
      - Validate provider value (aws|gcp|azure)
      - Load specified skill regardless of detection results

      **Multi-Cloud Projects**:
      - Check `all_results` array for multiple providers
      - Load all relevant skills if multiple providers detected
      - Provide unified interface for cross-cloud operations

  - priority: high
    title: Tooling Detection & Skill Loading
    description: |
      **At Task Start**:
      1. Run tooling detection: `node skills/tooling-detector/detect-tooling.js`
      2. Analyze detection results (tools detected, confidence, signals)
      3. Load appropriate skill(s) for each detected tool
      4. Log detection results and loaded skills for transparency

      **Detection Workflow**:
      ```bash
      # Detect infrastructure tooling
      TOOLING=$(node skills/tooling-detector/detect-tooling.js /path/to/project)

      # Parse results
      FLYIO_DETECTED=$(echo $TOOLING | jq -r '.tools[] | select(.tool=="flyio") | .confidence')
      HELM_DETECTED=$(echo $TOOLING | jq -r '.tools[] | select(.tool=="helm") | .confidence')
      K8S_DETECTED=$(echo $TOOLING | jq -r '.tools[] | select(.tool=="kubernetes") | .confidence')

      # Load Fly.io skill if detected (≥70% confidence)
      if [ ! -z "$FLYIO_DETECTED" ]; then
        echo "🚀 Fly.io detected (confidence: ${FLYIO_DETECTED})"
        cat skills/flyio/SKILL.md
        # Load REFERENCE.md if advanced Fly.io patterns needed
      fi

      # Load Helm skill if detected (≥70% confidence)
      if [ ! -z "$HELM_DETECTED" ]; then
        echo "📦 Helm detected (confidence: ${HELM_DETECTED})"
        cat skills/helm/SKILL.md
        # Load REFERENCE.md if complex Helm patterns needed
      fi

      # Load Kubernetes skill if detected (≥70% confidence)
      if [ ! -z "$K8S_DETECTED" ]; then
        echo "☸️  Kubernetes detected (confidence: ${K8S_DETECTED})"
        cat skills/kubernetes/SKILL.md
        # Load REFERENCE.md if advanced patterns needed
      fi
      ```

      **Manual Override**:
      - Accept `--tools=flyio,helm,kubernetes` flag to bypass detection
      - Load specified skills regardless of detection results
      - Useful for new projects without existing manifests

      **Multi-Tool Projects**:
      - Fly.io + Kubernetes: Hybrid edge + core architecture
      - Helm charts typically contain Kubernetes manifests (both detected)
      - Load all relevant skills when multiple tools detected
      - Skills work together: coordinated deployment strategies
