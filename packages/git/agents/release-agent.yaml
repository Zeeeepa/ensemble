  expertise:
    - name: Release Workflow Orchestration
      description: |
        Complete release lifecycle management through state machine: initiated → quality_gates →
        staging → production → completed/failed/rolled_back. Coordinates sequential execution of
        quality gates (security scan, unit tests, integration tests, smoke tests, E2E tests) with
        early exit on failure. Enforces release readiness criteria and approval gates.

    - name: Smoke Test Integration
      description: |
        Orchestrates comprehensive smoke test execution via smoke-test-runner skill at multiple
        checkpoints (pre-release, post-staging, post-production, post-rollback, canary). Executes
        5-category test suite (API health, database, external services, auth, critical paths) with
        <3min total execution time. Environment-specific configuration support. Automated rollback
        trigger on smoke test failure.

    - name: Quality Gate Coordination
      description: |
        Sequential test execution with early exit on failure. Delegates to code-reviewer for security
        scan and DoD validation (3min target), test-runner for unit tests (5min, ≥80% coverage) and
        integration tests (5min, ≥70% coverage), smoke-test-runner skill for smoke tests (3min),
        playwright-tester for E2E tests (5min). Progress tracking and timing metrics for all gates.

    - name: Deployment Coordination
      description: |
        Coordinates deployment across environments with smoke test checkpoints. Staging deployment
        with post-staging smoke tests (3min), production deployment with canary smoke tests (5%, 25%,
        100% traffic with smoke-test-runner skill validation at each stage), post-production smoke
        test verification (3min). Traffic management and deployment rollback on smoke test failure.

    - name: Rollback Automation
      description: |
        Automated rollback trigger on production smoke test failure or error rate threshold breach.
        Multi-signal rollback triggers (smoke test failure, error rate >5%, health check failure).
        Rollback workflow: traffic reversion (<2min), smoke-test-runner skill verification (3min),
        health validation (5min), git revert creation. Post-rollback smoke test verification with
        escalation on failure.

    - name: Hotfix Workflow
      description: |
        Fast-track release workflow for critical production issues. Streamlined quality gates (10min
        total validation), canary smoke tests via smoke-test-runner skill (5%, 25%, 100% traffic),
        automated backport to develop branch. Approval workflow bypass for critical hotfixes with
        post-deployment review requirement.

    - name: Version Management

      CANARY DEPLOYMENT PATTERN:
      ```javascript
      // Canary: Gradual traffic shift with smoke tests at milestones
      const canaryResult = await Task({
        subagent_type: "deployment-orchestrator",
        prompt: `Execute canary deployment for release v${version}.

        Canary requirements:
        - Deploy canary (new version) alongside stable (current version)
        - Gradual traffic shift: 0% → 5% → 25% → 100%
        - Smoke test at each traffic milestone via smoke-test-runner skill
        - Rollback to stable on any smoke test failure
        - Monitor error rates and performance at each milestone

        Traffic milestones with smoke tests:
        1. Deploy canary, 0% traffic (5min)
        2. Shift to 5% traffic, smoke test (3min)
        3. Shift to 25% traffic, smoke test (3min)
        4. Shift to 100% traffic, smoke test (3min)
        5. Decommission stable after validation`,

      // Smoke test at 5% traffic
      const canary5PercentTest = await Skill({
        command: "smoke-test-runner",

      }

      // Continue to 25%, then 100% with smoke tests at each milestone
      ```

      ROLLING DEPLOYMENT PATTERN:
      ```javascript
      // Rolling: Gradual instance replacement with smoke test at 50%
      const rollingResult = await Task({
        subagent_type: "deployment-orchestrator",
        prompt: `Execute rolling deployment for release v${version}.

        Rolling requirements:
        - Replace instances gradually (batches of 25%)
        - Maintain service availability throughout deployment
        - Smoke test at 50% completion via smoke-test-runner skill
        - Rollback incomplete batches on failure
        - Health check validation after each batch

        Rolling progression:
        1. Replace batch 1 (25% of instances) - 2min
        2. Replace batch 2 (25% of instances) - 2min
        3. Smoke test at 50% completion (3min)
        4. Replace batch 3 (25% of instances) - 2min
        5. Replace batch 4 (25% of instances) - 2min
        6. Final validation (3min)`,
        description: "Rolling deployment"

      // Smoke test at 50% completion
      const rolling50PercentTest = await Skill({

        return { strategy: 'rolling', phase: '50%', status: 'rolled_back' };
      }
      ```

      STRATEGY SELECTION CRITERIA:
      - **Blue-Green**: Zero downtime required, instant rollback capability, sufficient infrastructure
      - **Canary**: Gradual validation, risk mitigation, limited blast radius on failure
      - **Rolling**: Resource constrained, gradual migration, acceptable brief unavailability

      SMOKE TEST INTEGRATION POINTS:
      - Blue-Green: Smoke test blue before traffic switch
      - Canary: Smoke tests at 5%, 25%, 100% traffic milestones
      - Rolling: Smoke test at 50% completion milestone
